### New Approach - Pedagogical Best Practices

## 1. THUMBNAIL (3-5 seconds)
**Visual:** Gemini-generated image (brief visual hook only)
**Narration:** "Welcome to Circle Theorems"
**Purpose:** Visual introduction only - NO TEXT to avoid spelling errors

---

## 2. INTRODUCTION (15-20 seconds)
**Visual:** Manim scene with:
- Lesson title
- Exam relevance badge: "Popular GCSE Higher Topic"
- Difficulty indicator

**Narration:**
"The Angle at Centre theorem is one of the most important circle theorems you'll encounter in GCSE Mathematics. It appears frequently in both calculator and non-calculator papers, and understanding it will unlock many geometry problems."

---

## 3. THEORY (30-40 seconds)
**Visual:** Manim animated proof:
- Draw circle with center O
- Mark arc AB
- Draw angle at center (∠AOB)
- Draw angle at circumference (∠ACB) from same arc
- Animate the relationship visually
- Show theorem statement in box

**Narration:**
"Here's the key principle: When two angles are subtended by the same arc, the angle at the centre is exactly twice the angle at the circumference. Watch as we construct this relationship step by step. We have our circle with center O, points A and B on the circumference creating an arc. The angle at the center is theta, and the angle at the circumference from point C is exactly half of theta. This relationship ALWAYS holds true."

## 4. WORKED EXAMPLE (60-80 seconds)

### 4a. Question Display (10-15 seconds)
**Visual:** Manim scene showing:
```
Question
─────────

In the diagram, O is the center of the circle.
Points A, B, and C lie on the circumference.
Angle AOB = 140°

Given:
• O is the center
• A, B, C are on the circumference
• ∠AOB = 140°

Find: Angle ACB
```

**Narration:**
"Let's apply this theorem to a typical exam question. We have a circle with center O. The angle at the center, angle AOB, is 140 degrees. We need to find angle ACB at the circumference."

### 4b. Solution Approach (5-10 seconds)
**Visual:** Text: "This problem is typically solved in 2 steps"

**Narration:**
"This type of problem follows a simple two-step approach."

### 4c. Step 1 (15-20 seconds)
**Visual:** Manim scene:
```
Step 1 of 2
Identify the relationship

The angles AOB and ACB are subtended by the same arc AB.
Therefore, we can use the angle at centre theorem.

∠AOB = 2 × ∠ACB
```

**Narration:**
"Step 1: Identify the relationship. Both angles are subtended by the same arc AB, so we can apply the angle at centre theorem. The angle at the center equals two times the angle at the circumference."

### 4d. Step 2 (15-20 seconds)
**Visual:** Manim scene with calculation:
```
Step 2 of 2
Calculate the angle

∠AOB = 2 × ∠ACB
140° = 2 × ∠ACB
∠ACB = 140° ÷ 2
∠ACB = 70°  ✓
```

**Narration:**
"Step 2: Calculate the angle. We substitute 140 degrees for angle AOB, then divide both sides by 2 to find angle ACB equals 70 degrees."

## 5. COMMON PITFALLS (30-40 seconds)
**Visual:** Manim scene with ticks and crosses:

```
Common Pitfalls ⚠

Mistake 1:
✗ Assuming all angles in a circle are equal
✓ Check which arc subtends each angle

Mistake 2:
✗ Forgetting to identify which angle is at the center
✓ Always locate the center point O first

Mistake 3:
✗ Dividing the circumference angle by 2 (backwards!)
✓ The CENTER angle is bigger - divide IT by 2
```

**Narration:**
"Watch out for these common mistakes. First, don't assume all angles in a circle are equal - always check which arc subtends each angle. Second, make sure you identify which angle is at the center before applying the theorem. And third, remember: the angle at the CENTRE is the bigger one - you divide it by 2, not the other way around."
