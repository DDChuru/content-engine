# Chat Message Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem
Messages were disappearing immediately after being displayed due to chatSessionId changing from 'chat-initial' to a timestamp-based ID after mount, which triggered a message reset in the ChatInterface component.

## Root Cause
The chatSessionId was being initialized differently on server ('chat-initial') and client (timestamp-based), causing:
1. Hydration mismatch errors
2. The chatSessionId change after mount triggered the useEffect that reset messages
3. Messages would flash briefly then disappear

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Stable Initial Value (page.tsx)
- Initialize chatSessionId with 'chat-initial' consistently on both server and client
- Generate unique ID only after mount in useEffect
- This prevents hydration mismatches

### 2. Initial Mount Guard (chat-interface.tsx)
- Added `isInitialMount` ref to track first render
- Skip message reset on initial mount even when chatSessionId changes
- Only reset messages when "New Chat" is clicked (subsequent changes)

### 3. Non-blocking Firebase Saves
- Removed `await` from Firebase save operations
- Made saves fire-and-forget to prevent UI blocking

## Debug Logging Added
The following console logs will help verify the fix:

1. `[Home] Generating unique chat ID after mount:` - Shows when unique ID is generated
2. `[ChatInterface] chatSessionId effect triggered` - Shows when effect runs with details
3. `[ChatInterface] Initial mount detected, skipping reset` - Confirms initial mount guard works
4. `[ChatInterface] Adding assistant message:` - Tracks when messages are added
5. `[ChatInterface] Messages state update:` - Shows state update counts
6. `[ChatInterface] Rendering messages:` - Shows what's being rendered

## Expected Behavior
1. On page load: Welcome message stays visible
2. When sending a message: Response appears and persists
3. When clicking "New Chat": Messages clear and welcome message reappears

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Refresh page - welcome message should stay visible
- [ ] Send a message - response should persist in chat
- [ ] Send multiple messages - all should remain visible
- [ ] Click "New Chat" - messages should clear correctly
- [ ] Check browser console for no hydration errors
- [ ] Verify console logs show correct flow
