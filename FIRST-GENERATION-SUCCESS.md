## What Was Generated

### Module Details
- **Title:** Circle Theorem: Angle at Centre
- **Duration:** 55 seconds (3 scenes)
- **Cost:** $0.24
- **Voice:** Dachu (cloned voice ID: `dBiqpm68kZ0u53ND13mB`)
- **Quality:** 3Blue1Brown-level Manim animations

### Scene Breakdown

#### Scene 1: Introduction (10 seconds)
- **Type:** Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
- **Visual:** `packages/backend/output/education/images/Introduction_1761285577061.png` (1.1MB)
- **Audio:** `packages/backend/output/education/audio/scene_1.mp3` (178KB)
- **Narration:** "Welcome to this lesson on circle theorems. Today we'll explore one of the most fundamental relationships in circle geometry - the angle at the centre theorem. This powerful theorem reveals a precise mathematical relationship between angles formed at different positions in a circle."

#### Scene 2: Angle at Centre Theorem (25 seconds)
- **Type:** Manim Mathematical Animation
- **Visual:** `packages/backend/media/videos/Angle_at_Centre_Theorem_1761285579927/480p15/AngleatCentre.mp4` (273KB)
- **Audio:** `packages/backend/output/education/audio/scene_2.mp3` (254KB)
- **Narration:** "The angle at the centre theorem states that the angle subtended by an arc at the centre of a circle is exactly twice the angle subtended by the same arc at any point on the circumference. Watch carefully as we construct this relationship step by step."

#### Scene 3: Worked Example (20 seconds)
- **Type:** Manim Mathematical Animation
- **Visual:** `packages/backend/media/videos/Worked_Example_1761285586712/480p15/AngleatCentre.mp4` (273KB)
- **Audio:** `packages/backend/output/education/audio/scene_3.mp3` (246KB)
- **Narration:** "Let's apply this theorem to solve a problem. If the angle at the centre is 100 degrees, what is the angle at the circumference? Using our theorem, we divide by 2 to get 50 degrees. This relationship always holds true for any arc of the circle."

## Problems Solved During Generation

### 1. Environment Variable Loading âœ…
**Issue:** `.env` file had leading spaces, dotenv couldn't parse
**Fix:** Reformatted `.env` to remove spaces and moved dotenv.config() before imports

### 2. ElevenLabs API Method âœ…
**Issue:** `this.client.generate()` doesn't exist in v2.20.1
**Fix:** Updated to `this.client.textToSpeech.convert()`

### 3. Manim Output Parsing âœ…
**Issue:** Regex couldn't match multiline paths in Manim output
**Fix:** Clean output by removing newlines before regex matching

### 4. Geometry Scene Type âœ…
**Issue:** "Worked Example" defaulted to unimplemented 'geometry' type
**Fix:** Added "example" and "angle" keywords to circle_theorem detection
