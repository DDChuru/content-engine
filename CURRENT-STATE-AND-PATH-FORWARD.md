# Current State & Focused Path Forward

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Decision:** Stop spreading work across branches. Focus on master. Ship fast.

## ‚úÖ What We've Built (This Worktree)

### Educational Content Generation System
1. **Layer 3 - Quizzes** ‚úÖ
   - 30+ automated tests
   - Smart answer normalization
   - Pre-build validation
   - Production-ready

2. **Layer 2 - Examples** ‚úÖ (Core logic working)
   - Gemini image generation (NO TEXT policy)
   - Manim animation generation
   - Minor Remotion file path config needed

3. **Layer 1 - Main Content** ‚úÖ (Core logic working)
   - Agent registry framework
   - Mixed visual types (Manim + Gemini + SVG)
   - Video composition logic complete

4. **Services**
   - GeminiImageGenerator (strict NO TEXT)
   - ManimRenderer
   - VideoRenderer
   - Exercise/Examples/TopicContentGenerator

**Status:** Core logic works. Tested. Documented. Just needs Remotion path fix + UI.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem (Why We're Here)

1. **Too many branches** (5+ feature branches)
2. **Too much spread** (worktrees, main repo, scattered work)
3. **Secrets in git history** (can't push feature branch)
4. **Lost focus** (building too many things at once)

**Result:** Hard to merge, hard to track, hard to ship.

---

## üéØ The Solution: FOCUSED DEVELOPMENT

### New Strategy (Starting NOW)

**1. Work on Master Branch**
- No more long-lived feature branches
- Commit frequently to master
- Small, incremental changes
- Always buildable

**2. One Thing at a Time**
- ‚ùå No: "Let's build education + YouTube + TikTok + agent system"
- ‚úÖ Yes: "This week: Educational content UI only"

**3. Ship Fast**
- Monday: Fix Remotion paths
- Tuesday: Start UI
- Wednesday: Educational content form
- Thursday: Video preview
- Friday: Deploy & demo

---

## üìù Immediate Actions (Today)

### Step 1: Copy Work to Main Repo (Manual) ‚úÖ
Since we can't push due to secrets in history, manually copy the working code:

```bash
# In worktree - copy important files
cd /home/dachu/Documents/projects/worktrees/educational-content/packages/backend/src

# Copy to main repo
cp -r services /home/dachu/Documents/projects/content-engine/packages/backend/src/
cp -r tests /home/dachu/Documents/projects/content-engine/packages/backend/src/
cp -r scripts /home/dachu/Documents/projects/content-engine/packages/backend/src/

# Copy docs
cd /home/dachu/Documents/projects/worktrees/educational-content/packages/backend
cp QUIZ-VALIDATION-GUIDE.md VISUAL-ASSET-GENERATION-FIX.md EDUCATION-TEST-PLAN.md /home/dachu/Documents/projects/content-engine/packages/backend/

# Commit in main repo
cd /home/dachu/Documents/projects/content-engine
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Educational content generation - core services

- Quiz validation system (30+ tests)
- Gemini image generator (NO TEXT policy)
- Manim renderer integration
- Examples/Topics/Exercise generators
- Agent registry framework

Status: Core logic working, ready for UI"

git push origin master
```

### Step 2: Abandon Feature Branch
- Don't try to merge `feature/educational-content`
- Work directly on master from now on
- Worktree can stay for reference, but work in main repo

### Step 3: Focus on ONE Thing
**This Week:** Educational Content UI + Remotion Fix

**Nothing else.** No YouTube. No TikTok. No agent workspace. Just this one thing.

- [x] Document current state
- [ ] Copy working code to main repo
- [ ] Fix Remotion file path issue
- [ ] Commit to master

### Tuesday
- [ ] Design educational content UI wireframe
- [ ] Set up routing (`/app/education`)
- [ ] Create topic list component
- [ ] Create generation form

### Wednesday
- [ ] Connect form to backend API
- [ ] Add video preview component
- [ ] Add cost tracker
- [ ] Test generation flow

### Thursday
- [ ] Add quiz preview/testing
- [ ] Polish UI/UX
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Loading states

### Friday
- [ ] Deploy to Railway/Vercel
- [ ] Demo to stakeholders
- [ ] Document for users
- [ ] Celebrate win üéâ

---

## üéØ Success Metrics (This Week)

- [ ] Generate Cambridge IGCSE topic from UI
- [ ] Preview video in browser
- [ ] Test quiz interactively
- [ ] Cost < $2 per module
- [ ] Deploy URL working
- [ ] Demo completed

---

## üìö What Happens to Other Work?

### Archive (For Now)
- TikTok multilingual
- VEO video generation
- Scenario agents
- Voice cloning pipeline

**We'll come back to these AFTER educational content ships.**

### Keep Active
- Educational content (this week)
- User manual generation (already working)
- Generic chat/code assistance (needed for UI dev)

---

## üîë Key Principles Going Forward

1. **Master is King**
   - All work happens on master
   - Always buildable
   - Push daily

2. **One Thing at a Time**
   - 1 feature per week
   - No context switching
   - Deep focus

3. **Ship Fast**
   - 1 week max per feature
   - Demo every Friday
   - Iterate based on feedback

4. **No Secrets in Git**
   - Use `.gitignore` for all keys
   - Environment variables only
   - Never commit `*-service-account.json`

5. **Less Documentation, More Code**
   - Code is the documentation
   - README per feature
   - Comments in code
   - No 50-page planning docs

---

## üìã Next Steps (Right Now)

1. ‚úÖ **Document current state** (this file)
2. **Copy code to main repo** (manual sync)
3. **Fix Remotion paths** (1 hour)
4. **Commit to master** (clean history)
5. **Start UI foundation** (Tuesday)

## üí° Lessons Learned

### What Didn't Work
- ‚ùå Long-lived feature branches (merge hell)
- ‚ùå Multiple worktrees (confusion)
- ‚ùå Building 5 things at once (no focus)
- ‚ùå Committing secrets (GitHub blocks push)
- ‚ùå Over-documentation (analysis paralysis)

### What Will Work
- ‚úÖ Master-only development
- ‚úÖ One feature at a time
- ‚úÖ Ship weekly
- ‚úÖ Clean .gitignore
- ‚úÖ Code over docs

---

## üéØ Vision (Unchanged)

**Build AI-powered content generation platform with:**
- Educational content (Cambridge IGCSE, SCORM)
- YouTube videos (voice cloning + animations)
- TikTok shorts (multilingual)
- User manuals (codebase analysis)
- Generic code chat (Claude Code replacement)

**But:** Ship one at a time. Educational content first.

---

## ‚úÖ Ready to Execute?

**Yes.** Let's:
1. Copy code to main repo
2. Fix Remotion
3. Build UI
4. Ship by Friday

**Focus. Ship. Repeat.** üöÄ
