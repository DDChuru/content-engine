## 1. Circle Geometry

### 1.1 Circle Vocabulary

Students must use and interpret the vocabulary of circles:
- **Centre** - The fixed point equidistant from all points on the circle
- **Radius** (plural: radii) - The distance from the centre to any point on the circumference
- **Diameter** - A straight line passing through the centre, connecting two points on the circumference (2 × radius)
- **Circumference** - The perimeter of the circle
- **Semicircle** - Half of a circle, formed by a diameter
- **Chord** - A straight line joining two points on the circumference
- **Tangent** - A line that touches the circle at exactly one point
- **Arc** - A part of the circumference
- **Sector** - A region bounded by two radii and an arc
- **Segment** - A region bounded by a chord and an arc

### 1.2 Circle Measurements

**Learning Objectives:**
- Calculate the circumference of a circle using C = πd or C = 2πr
- Calculate the area of a circle using A = πr²
- Calculate arc length as a fraction of the circumference
- Calculate sector area as a fraction of the area of a circle

**Key Formulas:**
- Circumference: C = πd = 2πr
- Area: A = πr²
- Arc length: (θ/360°) × 2πr (where θ is the angle at centre)
- Sector area: (θ/360°) × πr²

### 1.3 Circle Theorems

Students must understand, prove, and apply the following geometrical properties:

#### Theorem 1: Equal Chords and Centre Distance
**Statement:** Equal chords are equidistant from the centre

**Key Points:**
- If two chords have the same length, they are the same distance from the centre
- Conversely, chords equidistant from the centre are equal in length

#### Theorem 2: Perpendicular Bisector of Chord
**Statement:** The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre

**Key Points:**
- A line from the centre perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord
- A line through the centre and the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord
- If a radius (or diameter) goes through the midpoint of a chord, it bisects the chord at right angles

#### Theorem 3: Tangent-Radius Property
**Statement:** Tangents from an external point are equal in length

**Key Points:**
- If a radius and a tangent meet at a point on the circumference, the angle between them is 90°
- Two tangents drawn from the same external point are equal in length
- The line joining the external point to the centre bisects the angle between the tangents

#### Theorem 4: Angle at Centre
**Statement:** The angle at the centre of a circle is twice the angle at the circumference

**Key Points:**
- Both angles must be subtended by the same arc
- Formula: Angle at centre = 2 × Angle at circumference
- The angle in a semicircle is always 90° (since the angle at centre is 180°)

#### Theorem 5: Angles in Same Segment
**Statement:** Angles in the same segment are equal

**Key Points:**
- Angles subtended by the same arc at the circumference are equal
- These angles lie in the same segment
- Useful for finding unknown angles when points lie on the circle

#### Theorem 6: Opposite Angles in Cyclic Quadrilateral
**Statement:** Angles in opposite segments are supplementary (add to 180°)

**Key Points:**
- A cyclic quadrilateral is formed by four points on the circumference
- Opposite angles add up to 180°
- If one angle is known, its opposite can be found by: Opposite angle = 180° - Known angle

#### Theorem 7: Alternate Segment Theorem
**Statement:** The angle between a tangent and a chord equals the angle in the alternate segment

**Key Points:**
- The angle formed between a tangent and a chord at the point of contact
- This angle equals the angle subtended by the same chord in the alternate (opposite) segment
- Also known as the tangent-chord theorem

### 1.4 Assessment Requirements

Students must be able to:
- Calculate unknown angles using circle theorems
- Provide geometrical explanations and reasons for their working
- Apply multiple circle theorems in combination to solve complex problems
- Construct formal geometric proofs using circle properties
- Solve problems involving tangent lengths, chord properties, and angles

## 2. Differentiation

### 2.1 Understanding Differentiation

**Learning Objective:** Understand the idea of a derived function

**Key Concepts:**
- Differentiation finds the rate of change of a function
- The derivative represents the gradient (slope) of a function at any point
- Notation: If y = f(x), then dy/dx or f'(x) represents the derivative
- Geometric meaning: The derivative at a point gives the gradient of the tangent to the curve at that point

### 2.2 Differentiating Polynomial Functions

**Learning Objective:** Use the derivatives of functions of the form axⁿ, and simple sums of not more than three of these

**Where:**
- a is a rational constant
- n is a positive integer or 0

**Differentiation Rule:**
If y = axⁿ, then dy/dx = n × axⁿ⁻¹

**Examples of Function Forms:**
1. Single term: y = 5x³
   - dy/dx = 15x²

2. Two terms: y = 3x⁴ + 2x²
   - dy/dx = 12x³ + 4x

3. Three terms: y = x⁵ - 4x² + 7x
   - dy/dx = 5x⁴ - 8x + 7

**Special Cases:**
- Constant: If y = c, then dy/dx = 0
- Linear: If y = mx + c, then dy/dx = m
- y = x, then dy/dx = 1

### 2.3 Applications to Gradients

**Learning Objective:** Apply differentiation to gradients

**Key Applications:**
1. **Finding Gradient at a Point:**
   - Differentiate the function
   - Substitute the x-value into dy/dx
   - The result is the gradient at that point

2. **Equation of Tangent:**
   - Find gradient using differentiation
   - Use point-gradient form: y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)

3. **Equation of Normal:**
   - Find gradient of tangent (m₁)
   - Gradient of normal: m₂ = -1/m₁ (negative reciprocal)
   - Use point-gradient form with the normal gradient

### 2.4 Turning Points (Stationary Points)

**Learning Objective:** Apply differentiation to turning points (stationary points)

**Definition:** A stationary point is where dy/dx = 0 (gradient is zero)

**Finding Stationary Points:**
1. Differentiate the function to get dy/dx
2. Set dy/dx = 0
3. Solve for x to find x-coordinates of stationary points
4. Substitute x-values back into original equation to find y-coordinates

**Types of Stationary Points:**
- Maximum point (peak)
- Minimum point (trough)
- Point of inflection (saddle point - rare in IGCSE)

### 2.5 Discriminating Between Maxima and Minima

**Learning Objective:** Discriminate between maxima and minima by any method

**Method 1: Second Derivative Test**
1. Find first derivative: dy/dx
2. Find second derivative: d²y/dx²
3. Evaluate d²y/dx² at the stationary point:
   - If d²y/dx² > 0: Minimum point
   - If d²y/dx² < 0: Maximum point
   - If d²y/dx² = 0: Test inconclusive (use another method)

**Method 2: Gradient Change Method**
1. Find dy/dx
2. Test gradient on either side of the stationary point
3. If gradient changes from + to -: Maximum
4. If gradient changes from - to +: Minimum

**Method 3: Table of Values**
1. Choose x-values slightly before and after the stationary point
2. Calculate y-values for these x-values
3. Compare y-values:
   - If stationary point has highest y-value: Maximum
   - If stationary point has lowest y-value: Minimum

### 2.6 Real-World Applications

**Common Problem Types:**
- Maximizing area or volume with constraints
- Minimizing cost or distance
- Optimization problems
- Rate of change problems

**Problem-Solving Steps:**
1. Express the quantity to be optimized as a function
2. Differentiate the function
3. Find stationary points by setting derivative = 0
4. Determine whether maximum or minimum
5. Answer the question in context
