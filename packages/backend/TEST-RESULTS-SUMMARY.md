# Educational Content Generation - Test Results Summary

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Test:** Layer 2 (Examples) - Gemini + Manim + Remotion Integration
**Status:** ✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED**

---

## 🎉 Executive Summary

Successfully validated the complete educational content generation pipeline with **two critical fixes**:

1. **Remotion File Path Resolution** - Fixed 404 errors when accessing local assets
2. **Manim Text Collision** - Fixed overlapping text in WorkedExample animations

The system can now generate professional educational videos combining:
- Gemini-generated background images (NO TEXT policy)
- Manim-generated mathematical animations
- Remotion video composition

## ✅ Test Results

### Layer 2: Examples Generation

**Test Command:**
```bash
npx tsx test-example-generation.ts
```

**Results:**
```
Success: ✅ PASSED
Examples Generated: 3
Total Duration: 880 seconds (14.7 minutes)
Total Cost: $0.66
Execution Time: 107.21s
```

**Per-Example Metrics:**
| Example | Problem | Duration | Cost |
|---------|---------|----------|------|
| 1 | Find A ∪ B where A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5} | 302s | $0.23 |
| 2 | Find A ∩ B where A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6} | 276s | $0.21 |
| 3 | Find A' where A = {1, 2, 3} and ξ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} | 302s | $0.23 |

**Average cost per example: $0.22** ✅ (Target: < $1.00)

## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Remotion File Path Resolution ✅

**Problem:**
Remotion's dev server couldn't access local files, resulting in 404 errors:
```
[http://localhost:3000/output/test-examples/visuals/image.png]
Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)
EncodingError: The source image cannot be decoded
```

**Root Cause:**
Remotion can only access files in its `public` directory. Absolute file paths don't work via HTTP.

**Solution:**
Created **RemotionFileManager** service to:
1. Copy assets from their source locations to `src/remotion/public/`
2. Convert absolute paths to relative paths compatible with `staticFile()`
3. Automatically detect file types (video, image, audio)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/remotion-file-manager.ts` - NEW service
- `src/services/video-renderer.ts` - Copy assets before rendering
- `src/remotion/components/ImageScene.tsx` - Use `staticFile(imagePath)`
- `src/remotion/components/VideoScene.tsx` - Use `staticFile(videoPath)`

**Verification:**
```bash
$ ls -lh src/remotion/public/images/
total 6.4M
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dachu dachu 1.2M Oct 27 04:25 Mathematics_problem_background_*.png ✅
...

$ ls -lh src/remotion/public/videos/
total 1.3M
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dachu dachu 1.3M Oct 27 04:29 WorkedExample.mp4 ✅
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Assets copying successfully, no more 404 errors

---

### Fix 2: Manim Text Collision ✅

**Problem:**
In the WorkedExample Manim animation, the question text overlapped when transitioning from full-screen to corner:

**Before (Broken):**
```
Question:           ← Big centered text
Find: Angle ACB

                         [Transforms]

Question:          ← Shrunk text in corner
Find: Angle ACB    ← COLLISION! Overlaps with corner question
```

**Root Cause:**
Using `Transform(question_big, question_small)` kept the original "Find: Angle ACB" text visible, causing it to overlap with the transformed small question in the corner.

**Solution:**
Changed from Transform to FadeOut → FadeIn:

**File:** `src/services/manim-scenes/introduction-with-thumbnail.ts`

**Before:**
```python
self.play(Transform(question_big, question_small), run_time=1.5)
```

**After:**
```python
self.play(FadeOut(question_big), run_time=0.8)
question_small = VGroup(...)  # Fresh object
self.play(FadeIn(question_small), run_time=1.0)
```

**Benefits:**
- Completely removes old question before showing new one
- No overlapping text
- Cleaner visual transition
- Total time: 1.8s (vs 1.5s) - acceptable increase

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - No text collisions in generated videos

---

### Fix 3: Manim Path Parsing ✅

**Problem:**
Manim output contained newline characters in file paths:
```
/home/dachu/Documents/pro
                          jects/worktrees/educationa
                          l-content/packages/backend
```

**Solution:**
Updated path extraction regex in `manim-renderer.ts`:

**Before:**
```typescript
const cleanOutput = stdout.replace(/\n\s+/g, ' ');  // Replaced with space
const videoPath = match[1];  // Still had spaces
```

**After:**
```typescript
const cleanOutput = stdout.replace(/\n\s+/g, '');  // Remove completely
const videoPath = match[1].replace(/\s+/g, '');  // Extra safety
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Paths are clean
