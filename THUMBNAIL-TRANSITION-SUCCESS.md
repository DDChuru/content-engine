### Scene Breakdown

#### Scene 1: Introduction with Thumbnail Transition (12s)
```
0.0s  → Gemini thumbnail appears full screen
1.0s  → Thumbnail starts shrinking and moving to bottom right
1.5s  → Thumbnail reaches corner (small logo size)
        Title appears: "Circle Theorem: Angle at Centre"
        Exam badge appears: "Popular GCSE Higher Topic"
2.0s  → Thumbnail fades from corner
2-12s → Narrator introduces topic with exam context
```

**Features:**
- ✓ Smooth animation transition
- ✓ Professional branding effect
- ✓ Exam relevance badge (GCSE Higher)
- ✓ Difficulty indicator (Orange - Higher level)

#### Scene 2: Theory Proof (30s)
```
- Draw circle with center point O
- Add points A, B, C on circumference
- Draw angle at centre (120°) with MathTex label
- Draw angle at circumference (60°) with MathTex label
- Show mathematical relationship: 120° = 2 × 60°
- Display theorem statement box
```

**Features:**
- ✓ Professional MathTex notation (∠AOB = 2 × ∠ACB)
- ✓ Smooth animations with Manim
- ✓ Color-coded angles (Yellow for centre, Green for circumference)
- ✓ Theorem box at bottom

#### Scene 3: Worked Example (25s)
```
- Question header with exam-style layout
- Given: Angle AOB = 100°
- Find box: "Find: Angle ACB"
- Step 1: Apply the theorem
- Step 2: Calculate with MathTex equations
  - 100° = 2 × ∠ACB
  - ∠ACB = 100° ÷ 2 = 50°
- Green tick mark ✓ for correct answer
```

**Features:**
- ✓ Step-by-step approach
- ✓ MathTex for professional equations
- ✓ Visual feedback with tick mark
- ✓ Exam-style question layout

## 📊 Comparison

### Before (Basic System)
```
Scene 1: Gemini thumbnail (5s) - separate scene
Scene 2: Manim theory (25s)
Scene 3: Manim example (20s)
Total: 50s

Issues:
- Abrupt transition
- No exam context
- Text-only labels (no MathTex)
- Longer total duration
```

### After (Streamlined with Transition)
```
Scene 1: Intro with transition (12s) - thumbnail + exam context
Scene 2: Theory with MathTex (30s)
Scene 3: Example with steps (25s)
Total: 67s

Benefits:
✓ Smooth professional transition
✓ Exam relevance context
✓ MathTex notation (∠AOB = 2 × ∠ACB)
✓ Step-by-step solutions
✓ Visual feedback (ticks)
✓ Better engagement
```
