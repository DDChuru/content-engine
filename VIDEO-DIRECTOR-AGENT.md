**Agent:** "Excellent! Healthcare is a sensitive environment. Should we emphasize your infection control protocols? And do you want to mention specific certifications?"

**You:** "Yes, we're certified in healthcare cleaning standards. Also mention our 24/7 availability and emergency response team."

**Agent:** "Perfect! What about after-sales support - do you offer training or maintenance plans?"

**You:** "Good point! Yes, we provide staff training and quarterly audits."

**Agent:** "Great! I have everything I need. Shall we create your video?"
